The Duke APO Website

To get started contributing, checkout the ["Getting Started" page](https://github.com/DukeAPO/dukeapo.github.io/wiki) in the Wiki.

This website is built off of the ["Minimal Mistakes" Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Documentation for it can be found [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
